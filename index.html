        <p>Welcome to the completely randomized card game about life.
            <br> <br> The Most Easily Forgotten Thing is a card set inspired by Brian Eno's "Oblique Strategies," that creates quick, randomized mental health breaks. It is a low pressure, do-good tool that can be used at your own pace.
            <br> <br> Use the web randomizer version here:
        </p>
        <div class="container">
              <div id="cardspace">
                    <br>
                    <button type="button" onclick="generatenumber();">new card</button>
                </div>
            <script src="card-randomizer.js"></script>
        </html>        

            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="container">
            <div id="instructions">
                <p>OR! <br><br> Print your own set of cards to walk around with!
                    <br><br>
                    <a href="cards.pdf"> Click here for printable deck and play guide.</a>
                    <br><br> PRINT INSTRUCTIONS: <br><br>
                     Print to standard copy paper, I suggest using cardstock, if able, for a more durable card.
                     <br> <br> Print one sided, at "Actual Size" or "Scaling: 100%,"
                     <br> <br> Then use the dotted lines to cut out your cards... NOTE:    While the dotted lines do not extend to the edge of the paper, you should still be cutting to the edge.
                     <br> <br> The play guide at on the last page is a traditional one-page zine! Cut it out and follow these fold instructions:
                     <br> <br><img src="zineinstructions.jpg" alt="Zine fold instructions" class="img2">
                     <br> <br> The cards AND play guide will fit in a standard tin for storage, think Altoids. Or just throw them in a sandwhich bag! Whatever works.
